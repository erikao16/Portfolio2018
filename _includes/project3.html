It had an extensive number of usability issues. These included hard-to-read text and a lack of information architecture, on top of it not being responsive.</p></div></div><div class="flex"><div class="col-1"><h1 class="persona1">Persona1</h1></div><div class="col-1"><h1 class="persona2">Persona2</h1></div></div><div class="flex"><div class="col-2"><p>The first thing I did was create personas for customers of the store. They were based on my knowledge of the area's demographic, and knowledge that this was a higher-end store. In hindsight, I should've asked the store owner about his customer demographic instead of making assumptions.</p></div></div><div class="flex"><div class="col-2"><h1 class="styleguide">Style Guide</h1></div></div><div class="flex"><div class="col-2"><p>I followed this with a style guide, deciding on a contemporary theme to give the website a more polished look. However, one of my classmates pointed out that the logo seemed more rustic and traditional, which conflicted with this theme. If I were to do this project again, I would change the theme to be consistent with this.</p></div></div><div class="flex sitemap"><div class="col-1"><h1 class="sitemap">Site Map</h1></div><div class="col-1"><p>Next came the site map. I had a sample user (my mom!) do a card-sorting activity to see whether the organization made sense. In doing so, I learned that the original categories weren't as confusing as I had assumed, and I revised the categories I had initially created.</p></div></div><div class="flex"><iframe allowFullScreen frameborder="0" height="400" mozallowfullscreen src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/169942859" webkitAllowFullScreen width="90%"></iframe></div><div class="flex"><div class="col-2"><p class="vimeo">Here is a video of a user interacting with a paper prototype of the website redesign.</p></div></div><div class="flex"><div class="col-1"><h1 class="wireframes">Wireframes</h1></div><div class="col-1"><p class="wireframes">Some wireframes I made in Adobe Comp CC.</p></div></div><div class="flex"><div class="col-2"><h1 class="mockups">Mockups</h1><p class="mockups">A look at the mockups I ended up creating, branching out from the home page.</p></div></div><div class="flex"><iframe src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/170529580" width="90%" height="400" frameborder="0" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen></iframe><div class="col-2"><p class="prototype">This video clicks through the prototype, which you can interact with <a href="https://xd.adobe.com/view/6acaa87d-2ed6-483a-8c02-0f1446b4ae29/?featureset=cp" class="inline">here</a> .</p></div></div><div class="flex"><div class="col-2"><h1 class="big">Reflection</h1></div></div><div class="flex"><div class="col-2"><p>I missed an opportunity to talk to the store owner about these designs; by talking to him, I would've gained a better understanding of the users, as well as aligning my design with the store's brand. As this was more of a UI project, I didn't take the store's mission and values into consideration either; the focus of the project was more on reorganizing the website, and making aesthetic changes. Were I to take this on a second time, I would work directly with the store owner and a web developer to make sure I was staying on-brand.</p></div></div></section>
