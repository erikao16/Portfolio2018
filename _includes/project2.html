<section class="project2-page"><div class="flex"><div class="col-2"><h1 class="big">SlightSee Prototype</h1><p class="blurb">Here's a look at a prototyping project that I undertook during my winter break, 2016.</p></div></div><div class="flex"><div class="col-2"><h1 class="finalscreens">Final Screens</h1><p>As my friend drove me to the airport, I was notified of a flight delay, and she expressed how long layover times seem like such a huge waste of time. Every time she has one, she has the desire to explore the city outside the airport, but there is no one to show her around. Here came an opportunity to prototype an iOS app!</p></div></div><div class="flex"><div class="col-1"><h1 class="userflow">User Flow</h1></div><div class="col-1"><p>Here is a look at the user flow that I created. Thinking of the app as a combination of Yelp and AirBnB, I used this to organize the structure of the app.</p></div></div><div class="flex"><div class="col-2"><h1 class="onboarding">Onboarding</h1><p>Here's a look at the high-fidelity mockups I created in Sketch of the onboarding process.</p></div></div><div class="flex"><div class="col-1"><h1 class="dash-gif">Dash Gif</h1></div><div class="col-1"><p class="dash-gif">The information displayed for each guide. The goal here was to display enough information to make tourists comfortable with the guide they would be spending their time with.</p></div></div><div class="flex"><div class="col-1"><h1 class="message-box">Message Box</h1></div><div class="col-1"><p class="message-box">A crucial part of building trust was the initial message that people were sending each other. Here I constrained the number of characters people could type, and provided prompting questions to help them write an informative message.</p></div></div><div class="flex"><div class="col-2"><h1 class="fiveviews">Five Views</h1></div><div class="col-1"><p class="fiveviews">A final look at all the main interfaces. Here in the homepage is a look at all the tour guides in the area. I needed to include enough information so that people could differentiate between tour guides, but not overwhelm users. To overcome the trust barrier between strangers, I utilized the rating system that goes both ways. Lastly, in order to address the different use cases of guides and tourists, I created a toggle button to switch modes, after which the interfaces would toggle between guide mode and tourist mode.</p></div></div><div class="flex"><div class="col-2"><h1 class="big">Reflection</h1></div></div><div class="flex"><div class="col-2"><p>In this project, I was working alone; it would've been great to have a developer to consult with the feasibility of my ideas. In addition, this was a shorter design project with minimal user research; it would be interesting to take this prototype and conduct some user testing and gain feedback to improve it further. For example, was the information I was providing to tourists important? Did they want other information? What about the tour guides? They may need to get compensated with money, in which case tourists would have to pay them. Would people be willing to pay for this service? Is there another way to generate revenue, and compensate tour guides? Clearly, there was lots of user research that needed to be done.</p></div></div></section>
